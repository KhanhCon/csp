Solving 1D MSSCSP with genetic algorithm and artificial immune system <br/>
Crossover and mutation operators are slightly modified versions of Falkenauer's reprodcution operators[1] in conjunction with recursive first fit algorithm proposed by Toyoda[3] so that it would fit our mutiple stock sizes problem.
